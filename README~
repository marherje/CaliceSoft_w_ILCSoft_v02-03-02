This is a build using ILCSoft v02-03-02 with gcc10.3 and c++17 libraries.

The bash script replace_throws adapts most of the code to work.
Still, some errors will appear in userlib and need to be changed manually.
This change is simply changing the explicit "throws" in the function declaration
into a "noexcept(false)".

There's some additional issues with CMAKE policies that are addressed and may not hold well with time.
We tried this fix and didn't work:
GET_TARGET_PROPERTY(FULL_LIBRARY_NAME ${lib1name} LOCATION)
changed to:
SET(FULL_LIBRARY_NAME $<TARGET_FILE:${lib1name}>)

Instead, we called the old policy using: 
cmake_policy(SET CMP0026 OLD)
