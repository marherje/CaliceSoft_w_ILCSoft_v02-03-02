This is a build using ILCSoft v02-03-02 with gcc10.3 and c++17 libraries.

The bash script miraclefixing.sh checks and adapts all the code to make it work.
Still, some errors will appear in userlib the first time you recompile, they need to be changed manually.
This change is simply changing the explicit "throws" in the function declaration
into a "noexcept(false)".

There's some additional issues with CMAKE policies that are addressed and may not hold well with time.
We tried this fix and didn't work:
GET_TARGET_PROPERTY(FULL_LIBRARY_NAME ${lib1name} LOCATION)
changed to:
SET(FULL_LIBRARY_NAME $<TARGET_FILE:${lib1name}>)

Instead, we called the old policy using: 
cmake_policy(SET CMP0026 OLD)
