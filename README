This is a build using ILCSoft v02-03-02 with gcc10.3 and c++17 libraries.

The bash script miraclefixing.sh checks and adapts all the code to make it work.
Still, some errors will appear in userlib the first time you recompile, they need to be changed manually.
This change is simply changing the explicit "throws" in the function declaration
into a "noexcept(false)".

There's some additional issues with CMAKE policies that are addressed and may not hold well with time.
We tried this fix and didn't work:
GET_TARGET_PROPERTY(FULL_LIBRARY_NAME ${lib1name} LOCATION)
changed to:
SET(FULL_LIBRARY_NAME $<TARGET_FILE:${lib1name}>)

Instead, we called the old policy using: 
cmake_policy(SET CMP0026 OLD)


Extra note: This patch work as well with older versions of ILCSoft such as v02-02-03, 
but you'll need to import the softwre LighGBM using:
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#     LightGBM
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
export LIGHTGBM_HOME="/cvmfs/calice.desy.de/lightGBM/v2.3.1"
export PATH="$LIGHTGBM_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LIGHTGBM_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
also cmake might ask for the explicit definition of some paths such. For instance, for ilcutil in ILCSoft v02-02-03:
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
export ilcutil="/cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc82_centos7/v02-02-03/ilcutil/v01-06-02"
# --- additional ILCUTIL commands -------                                                                                                                     
export PATH="/cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc82_centos7/v02-02-03/ilcutil/v01-06-02/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ilcutil/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other (newer) versions of cmake require the definition of 'DIR', you just have to rewrite the export command 
with the same syntax that the error message requires.
