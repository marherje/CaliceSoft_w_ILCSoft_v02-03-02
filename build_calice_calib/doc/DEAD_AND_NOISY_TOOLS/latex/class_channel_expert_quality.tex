\subsection{Detailed Description}
A class holing the constants with define the detailed (expert) channel quality flags. 

These flags are for detailed analysis in the dead\-And\-Noisy\-Channels expert package. They are to be interpreted as a states of a bit field. Usage\-: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{comment}{// compose a quality word, use bitwise or}
UInt\_t thisChannelQuality = \hyperlink{class_channel_expert_quality_a0b17164b19cdc8619c1a93fe1728c4c3}{ChannelExpertQuality::highRMS} | 
      \hyperlink{class_channel_expert_quality_a13046f6e61373f907a79326530ee2e07}{ChannelExpertQuality::multiPeakNoise};
\textcolor{comment}{// thisChannelQuality now is 0xA, bits 1 and 3 set}

\textcolor{comment}{// check if a specific bit is set, use bitwise and}
\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} ( thisChannelQuality & ChannelExpertQuality::dead ) \{\textcolor{keywordflow}{continue};\} \textcolor{comment}{// skip if dead bit is set}
\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{DoxyAttention}{Attention}
These are not the flags written to the data base! These are defined in Cell\-Quality object of the userlib, which is the L\-C\-Generic\-Object written to the data base.

Explanation of the meaning/ current definitions (as of 12. Dec. 2010) \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily dead\-:} rms in the P\-M\-Noise spectrum is below a certain value \item {\ttfamily high\-R\-M\-S\-:} rms in the P\-M\-Noise spectrum is above a certain value \item {\ttfamily high\-Noise\-Rate\-:} (not implemented yet) channel is above M\-I\-P/noise cut in more than 10 \% of all events in an noise run \item {\ttfamily multi\-Peak\-Noise\-:} (not implemented yet) P\-M\-Noise spectrum has more than one peak \item {\ttfamily zombie\-:} (not implemented yet) Channel is dead in a certain period and sees signals again later \end{DoxyItemize}
