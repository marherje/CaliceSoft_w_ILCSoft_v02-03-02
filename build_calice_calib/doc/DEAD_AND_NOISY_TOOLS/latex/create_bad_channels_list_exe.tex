\hypertarget{create_bad_channels_list_exe_ListGeneration}{}\section{Creating a list of bad channels from a number of runs}\label{create_bad_channels_list_exe_ListGeneration}
Run the {\ttfamily create\-Bad\-Channels\-List} command with a list of run numbers (or a single run number) as arguments. The programme has to be run in the same directory as the input files, which have to be named R\-U\-N\-N\-U\-M\-B\-E\-R.\-root.

There is an option {\ttfamily --with5\-R\-M\-S\-Cut} to turn on the 5$\ast$\-R\-M\-S cut for the channel spectra (see \hyperlink{class_spectrum_properties_run_info_FiveRMSCut}{The 5$\ast$\-R\-M\-S cut section} of \hyperlink{class_spectrum_properties_run_info}{Spectrum\-Properties\-Run\-Info} class). This option has to be the first argument, the list of run numbers follows.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Currently also an ahc.\-cfg file is needed, the name A\-H\-Cfor\-C\-E\-R\-N2010.\-cfg is hard coded. This will change once the modified version of ahc\-Bin\-Hst is fully working and the mapping is already included in the histgram names.
\end{DoxyNote}
The executable produces the list of bad channels. The file is named {\ttfamily bad\-Channels.\-txt}. The channel status is according to\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000005}{Todo}]make channel status the one in userlib\-::\-Cell\-Quality.\end{DoxyRefDesc}


In addition you get a plot of the number of dead, noisy and bad (=dead + noisy) channels versus the run number, to monitor the history and see if all runs are ok or individual runs have to be excluded. You get a pdf and a C makro. The makro is useful to zoom into certain regions and identify \begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000006}{Todo}]Fix the hardcoded offset of 360000 in the run number for the x-\/axis on the history plot.\end{DoxyRefDesc}


From the history plot you can easily identify if there exceptionally few or many dead or noisy channels. Having a closer look at a run is done using the \hyperlink{root_lib}{root library}.
